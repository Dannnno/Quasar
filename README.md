## Dannnno's WebBrowser

This is a very long term project I'm going to play around with.  In general I'm interested in how to most effectively
write parsers and I'd like to practice using a well solved problem (html, js, css).  This way I can compare my
implementation to existing implementations and better locate edge cases I wouldn't otherwise notice.

I'm also interested in browser rendering - I'm curious how something parses an HTML file (and associated CSS, JS, etc)
and then displays it appropriately.  I want to play around with that as well.

In short, this rather ambitiously named project will eventually seek to have some level of functionality consistent with
other webbrowsers (on a much smaller scale in all likelihood)
